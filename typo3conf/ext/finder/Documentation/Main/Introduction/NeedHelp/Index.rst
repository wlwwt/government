Wiki
""""

Further help can be found in the wiki of the project at
`http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-finder/wiki
<http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-finder/wiki>`_

There are snippets, examples, tutorials, …

If you want to share something (remember: TYPO3 – inspiring people to
share), please add it to the issue tracker or send it per mail to me.


Mailing-list
""""""""""""

If you need help with the finder extension, you can always ask in the
public mailinglist  *typo3.projects.tt-finder* .  **Don't** send any
mail to one of developers at first!

If you got any extbase / fluid related questions which don't deal with
EXT:finder directly, it is maybe better to use the mailing-list
*typo3.projects.typo3v4mvc* .
